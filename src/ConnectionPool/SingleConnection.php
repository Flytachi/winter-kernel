/**
 * A "pool of one" for a single long-lived connection — the {@see ConnectionPool}
 * resilience without a coroutine Channel, for FPM requests and plain (non-coroutine)
 * long-running processes.
 *
 * It keeps one connection per instance and applies the same lifecycle maintenance on
 * every {@see get()}:
 *
 *   - **idle-gated validation** — a connection idle longer than
 *     {@see PoolPolicy::$aliveBypassWindow} is probed ({@see ConnectionFactory::validate()});
 *     a dead one is retired and reopened. A hot connection skips the probe.
 *   - **maxLifetime rotation** — a connection older than {@see PoolPolicy::$maxLifetime}
 *     is retired before it can go stale server-side.
 *
 * There is no jitter on the lifetime here (unlike the pool): a single connection per
 * process cannot form a thundering herd, and separate FPM processes open at different
 * times anyway.
 *
 * Unlike {@see ConnectionPool} this needs no coroutine — it never touches a Channel —
 * so it is safe under FPM/CLI. It is not coroutine-safe for concurrent callers; use
 * {@see ConnectionPool} when connections are shared across coroutines.
