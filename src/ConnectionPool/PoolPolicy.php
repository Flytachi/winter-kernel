     *   maintenance passes. Only relevant when a maintenance knob below is enabled.
     * @param float $keepaliveTime Seconds: the housekeeper proactively probes idle
     *   connections idle at least this long, retiring dead ones **before** a borrow
     *   sees them (and keeping idle-killing proxies/firewalls from dropping them).

     *   least this long, shrinking the pool down to `minimumIdle`. `0` = never shrink
     *   (HikariCP `idleTimeout`). Swoole only.
     * @param int $minimumIdle Warm floor the housekeeper maintains — it reopens
     *   connections up to this count and never shrinks below it. `0` = fully lazy
     *   (HikariCP `minimumIdle`). Swoole only.
