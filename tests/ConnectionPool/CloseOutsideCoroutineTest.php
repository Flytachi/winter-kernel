/**
 * Closing a pool must survive being called outside a coroutine.
 *
 * The `workerExit` handler releases the pool's housekeeping timer — a repeating timer
 * keeps the reactor from draining, and the worker is then force-killed with
 * "worker exit timeout". That handler runs **while the reactor is winding down**, which
 * is not a coroutine context, and `Channel::pop()` is a coroutine API:
 *
 *     Swoole\Error: API must be called in the coroutine
 *       ConnectionPool.php(149): Swoole\Coroutine\Channel->pop(0.001)
 *       PpaConnectionPool::shutdown()
 *       WinterApplication::{closure:serveHttp()}      ← workerExit
 *
 * It only fires when the pool still holds an idle connection, which is why an
 * application that never queries never sees it — and why a real one always does.
 *
 * Draining is skipped there rather than made to work: the process is terminating, so the
 * kernel closes the sockets either way, and every database treats a dropped client as
 * routine. What must not be skipped is the timer.
